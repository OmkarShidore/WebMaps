Python script to create webmaps with the help of folium to mark locations on maps.

This is an example of webmaps where I've shown address of some of my friends. you can check the map here: http://www.webmap.pe.hu

Setup: pip install folium

folium version = 0.7.0

Working: Once the script runs, it'll create an 'index.html' file you can open this file in any browser or host the index file to a server
